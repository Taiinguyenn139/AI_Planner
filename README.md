# 🚀 AI Project Planner  

**AI Project Planner** is an intelligent tool designed to help AI engineers and developers efficiently plan, structure, and execute AI projects. It leverages **LLMs (Large Language Models)** to generate structured roadmaps, prioritize tasks, recommend tech stacks, and provide clear outputs in various formats such as **TODO lists, Markdown, and JSON**.  

## ✨ Key Features  
- ✅ **Project Idea Refinement** – Ask structured questions to clarify and define the project scope.  
- ✅ **Roadmap Generation** – Automatically break down projects into key phases (Research, Development, Deployment).  
- ✅ **Task Prioritization** – Identify dependencies and suggest an optimized workflow.  
- ✅ **Tech Stack Recommendations** – Provide AI-driven suggestions for the best tools, frameworks, and libraries.  
- ✅ **Multiple Output Formats** – Export plans in TODO, Markdown, and JSON for easy integration into Notion, GitHub, or task managers.  
- ✅ **Logging & Metrics Visualization** – Track project progress, monitor LLM responses, and debug efficiently.  
- ✅ **CI/CD Support** – Automate deployment to keep the planner always up to date.  

## 🛠️ Technology Stack  
### **Backend**  
- FastAPI (for API endpoints)  
- Python (for AI processing and integrations)  

### **Frontend**  
- Streamlit / React (for the user interface)  

### **AI Model**  
- OpenAI API (or alternative LLM API)  

### **Database (if needed)**  
- PostgreSQL / Firebase  

### **Caching**  
- 🔥 **Redis** – Caching API responses, LLM outputs, and session data.  
- 🏎️ **Memcached** – Lightweight caching alternative for ephemeral storage.  

### **Monitoring & Logging**  
- 📊 **Prometheus & Grafana** – Real-time performance and usage monitoring.  
- 🔍 **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** – Centralized logging and analysis.  
- 🎯 **Jaeger** – Distributed tracing for debugging and performance insights.  
- 🛠️ **Sentry** – Error tracking and issue reporting.  

### **Reverse Proxy & Load Balancer**  
- 🚀 **NGINX** – Reverse proxy, load balancing, and security layer.  

### **CI/CD Pipeline**  
- **GitHub Actions / GitLab CI** – Automate testing and deployment.  

## ✅ TODO List  

### **Week 1 - MVP Development**
- [x] **Set up version control (Git + GitHub)**
- [x] **Define system architecture**
- [ ] **Integrate LLM API for roadmap generation**
- [ ] **Develop backend with FastAPI**
- [ ] **Implement frontend (Streamlit / React)**
- [ ] **Enable Markdown and TODO list output formats**
- [ ] **Basic logging for debugging**
- [ ] **Set up Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring**
- [ ] **Set up NGINX as a reverse proxy**
- [ ] **Basic CI/CD pipeline setup (GitHub Actions)**

### **Future Enhancements**
- [ ] **AI-powered project recommendations**
- [ ] **User authentication (OAuth/JWT)**
- [ ] **Collaboration features (team-based project planning)**
- [ ] **GitHub & Jira integration for task automation**
- [ ] **Real-time notifications for project updates**  

## 🧐 Why This Project?  
Many developers struggle with **structuring AI projects** and **managing tasks efficiently**. This tool helps by generating a **step-by-step roadmap**, ensuring projects start with a **clear plan** rather than feeling overwhelming.  

## 🔮 Future Enhancements  
- 🔹 **AI Coach** – Real-time suggestions when users get stuck.  
- 🔹 **Collaboration Features** – Allow multiple users to work on projects together.  
- 🔹 **Integration with GitHub/Jira** – Auto-generate GitHub Issues or Jira tasks from project plans.
